Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `sqlhelper` for local development.

1. Fork the `sqlhelper` repo on GitLab.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone https://github.com/<your_user_id_here>/sqlhelper.git

3. Make sure you have all the deps installed (your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have `devtools` installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ cd sqlhelper && R
    > devtools::load_all()

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. Test your feature out of the box (write tests!!!).

    > devtools::test()

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitLab website (https://github.com/)
